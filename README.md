# Terminal Messaging

**Unmainainted**: This plugin is unmaintained and was created as a proof of concept for an issue posted on the OctoPrint repo. Please see the official version that was adopted from this POC over [here](https://plugins.octoprint.org/plugins/terminalmessaging/) for feature requests or issues.

This plugin simply adjust the terminal output to look like a text message dialog using chat bubbles.
